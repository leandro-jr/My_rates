# My_rates
This project used Django to create Webstite where the user can add watched movies. When a new movie is added, the app collects some details about the production from imdb
(https://imdb-api.com/) and add it to a database. The user can rank the movies per year. The app also uses Django Rest Framework to add an API about the movies on the 
database.
